# @paperdave/logger

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- re-export `chalk` and `ansiEscapes` for ease of use ([`d0f6986`](https://github.com/paperdave/various/commit/d0f6986a6000a4d8888bf86a9cf5f566d0318e61))

- allow passing a single string instead of an object to `Progress`, `Spinner`, `withSpinner`, `withProgress`, which is shorthand for `{ text: ... }`. ([`d0f6986`](https://github.com/paperdave/various/commit/d0f6986a6000a4d8888bf86a9cf5f566d0318e61))

- `LogWidget.batchRedraw` supports nesting now ([`d0f6986`](https://github.com/paperdave/various/commit/d0f6986a6000a4d8888bf86a9cf5f566d0318e61))

- Updated dependencies [[`5548f17`](https://github.com/paperdave/various/commit/5548f1789f709e570691c0bfa7ae88cc8d550e3a)]:

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `trace` ([#32](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/32))

* All log functions accept and format error objects. ([#34](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/34))

- injection can handle uncaught errors automatically ([#32](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/32))

* deprecate `level`, `setLevel`, `LogLevel`, `fail`. ([#34](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/34))

- add custom namespaces using new `createLogger` function. ([#34](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/34))

  - all the built in log functions are created through this API.

* Add `trace`, `time`, `timeEnd`, `timeLog`, `count`, `countReset`, and `assert` to the injected console. ([#32](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/32))

- `error` now prints with an X symbol, and this is the standard for printing errors. ([#34](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/34))

  `success` is now seen as the opposite of an `error`. I used to say to avoid calling success too much, but with Spinners and Progress bars ending on a `success` check or `error` X message, these should probably be used more often, instead of `info` on a successful action being done.

### Patch Changes

- Explicitly define nodejs and bun version support. ([`5d0bd0d`](https://github.com/paperdave/various/commit/5d0bd0de6a8429802a66e393134a798b6ea2ff4f))

* injectConsole preferably takes an object instead of a console object, but this is not required yet. in v3, it will require for an object. ([#32](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/32))

- Add some badges to the readme indicating project status and release data ([`5d0bd0d`](https://github.com/paperdave/various/commit/5d0bd0de6a8429802a66e393134a798b6ea2ff4f))

* removed line wrapping ([#34](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/34))

- proper writing to standard error for errors and warnings and interactive content ([#34](https://github.com/paperdave/various/pull/34))
